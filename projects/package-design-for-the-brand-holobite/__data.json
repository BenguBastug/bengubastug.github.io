To enhance visual interest and convey the brand's vibrant spirit, I selected a dynamic color palette inspired by tropical elements. \n\nThe logo's color changes dynamically across four vibrant hues, a vibrant blue background represents the clean, refreshing ocean, while a vibrant red symbolizes the striking beauty of coral reefs. A soft pink background paired with vibrant blue font evokes the freshness of summery fruits. Additionally, a lush green background with vibrant yellow font brings to mind tropical forests and the warmth of the summer sun. \n\nFinally, a vibrant yellow background with a navy-purple font suggests the rich variety of tropical fruits. The packaging design incorporates a recurring brand logo inside a round shape reminiscent of a stamp, reinforcing the brand's exotic and premium feel. This cohesive visual language is designed to stand out in the competitive gin market, appealing to both connoisseurs and casual drinkers seeking a unique and luxurious experience.\n",[5,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21],"/projects/Mockup-Island Citrus-V2.png","/projects/Artboard 4.png","/projects/Artboard 5.png","/projects/Artboard 6.png","/projects/Artboard 7.png","/projects/Artboard 9.png","/projects/Artboard 10.png","/projects/Artboard 11.png","/projects/Artboard 12.png","/projects/Artboard 13.png","/projects/Artboard 14.png","/projects/Artboard 15.png","/projects/Asset 1.png","/projects/Moodboard.png",{"title":23,"thumb":24,"content":25,"photos":26},"Logo Design for the Brand \"Flipped\"","/projects/flipped (2).png","For the pancake company \"Flipped,\" which caters to young, hip customers, I developed a distinctive and playful brand identity. The typeface logo was crafted with a luxurious font, where select letters were given a bubbly, pancake-like appearance. \n\nThis subtle transformation adds a whimsical touch while maintaining an upscale feel. Within the font, I incorporated shapes that resemble melting dough, enhancing the playful vibe and making the design more engaging. These dough-melting shapes also serve as standalone logos for various packaging, creating a cohesive and versatile brand image. \n\nThe color palette was thoughtfully chosen to reflect the delightful flavors and experiences associated with pancakes, a pink background with purple font evokes the sweetness of blueberry and strawberry toppings, a mint background with light brown font hints at the freshness of cooked dough, and a light brown background with mint font offers a nod to classic, comforting pancake hues. This vibrant and innovative design not only captures the fun and modern essence of \"Flipped\" but also appeals to the trendy, youthful audience, making the brand both memorable and appealing.\n",[24,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34],"/projects/flipped (8).png","/projects/flipped (11).png","/projects/flipped (3).png","/projects/flipped (9).png","/projects/flipped (12).png","/projects/flipped (4).png","/projects/flipped (6).png","/projects/flipped (5).png",{"title":36,"thumb":37,"content":38,"photos":39},"Logo Design for the Brand \"Sabroso\"","/projects/Sabroso.png","I designed a typeface logo for \"Sabroso,\" a Mexican restaurant whose name means \"tasty\" or \"flavorful\" in Spanish, perfectly capturing the essence of its authentic and delicious cuisine. \n\nThe logo features a vibrant yellow background, symbolizing warmth and energy, with a striking red font color that conveys passion and excitement. The letters are outlined with a lush green stroke, providing a vintage feel and invoking nostalgia. \n\nTo further emphasize the fiery and spicy nature of the food, some letters are modified to be more pointy.
